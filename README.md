# Original kajig
## H1 Shitty 2 - Universal unenrollment (tested v31-v128) (does not require USB)
H1 Shitty 2 is a play on the name from the universal unenrollment method created by [@kelpseastem](https://github.com/kelpseastem) and [@Entrpix](https://github.com/entrpix).
## Requirements
- chromebook
- it must not be locked
- ability to count
- timer
### WARNING!!!
`dedede` Chromebooks have a non-zero chance to soft-brick when preforming H1 Shitty 2. The error might be "`TPM read error!`" or "`FWMP missing`". This is easily fixed by reinstalling ChromeOS using a recovery storage device.
##  How do I do it?
1. Powerwash (press `ctrl + alt + shift + r` on the login screen)
2. Proceed through setup as normal
3. When it starts to enroll, wait 1 second then restart by pressing `power + refresh`
4. When it starts to enroll again, wait 1 second and press `esc + power + refresh` then `power` to turn it off
5. Leave it off for ***at least*** 15 hours
6. When you turn it on, it should look like [this](https://github.com/kuromuiroha/CRSH2TTY/raw/main/Docs/Media/v128nissa.mp4) or something similar. You're unenrolled!
## Why is it called H1 Shitty 2?
It's a play on the original exploit name (that I won't say for reasons). H1 Shitty 1 required a non-zero amount of time to guess the password to the software on the H1 GSC on Chromebooks, where the code gets rolled every 3 attempts. H1 Shitty 2 doesn't do anything to the H1 or D2 software, but it still requires a 15 hour wait to get unenrolled.
## Is this patchable?
